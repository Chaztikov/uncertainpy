Plotting
========

:py:class:`~uncertainpy.plotting.PlotUncertainty` creates plot of the data
from the uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
``PlotUncertainpy`` plots the results for all zero and one dimensional statistical
metrics, and some of the two dimensional statistical metrics
It is intended as a quick way to get an overview of the data, and does not
create publication ready plots.
Custom plots of the data can easily be created by retrieving the results from
the :ref:`Data <Data>` class.
